There's a swan song coming for you...

A breath of fresh air, a Right Proper shaders mod built from the ground up for Minecraft 1.7.10!  
Designed with compatibility-first, around supporting modpacks old and new, tested against era-appropriate shaderpacks.

## Compatibility

Compatible with most other popular client-side optimization and graphics mods, including but not limited to:

- FalseTweaks
- Beddium
- Right Proper Lighting Engine
- Right Proper MCPatcher
- HodgePodge
- FastCraft
- CoreTweaks
- ArchaicFix
- BugTorch
- NotFine

With expected incompatibilities with:

- OptiFine (any)
- Original ShadersMod
- MCPatcher: Forge
- Neodymium (use Beddium)
- Angelica (May work with certain modules)

## Technical

SwanSong is a standalone replacement for [ShadersMod](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1286604-shaders-mod-updated-by-karyonix), with initial support focused on shaders that already work with [OptiFine 1.7.10_HD_U_E7](https://optifine.net/changelog?f=OptiFine_1.7.10_HD_U_E7.jar).

It is not a backport of Iris, nor a direct descendant of ShadersMod or the GLSL Shaders mod. Outside of acting as an implementation of the specification pioneered by said mods.

A few other goodies such as threaded screenshots, OptiFine-like zooming, and a faster font rendering module are included as a bonus!
